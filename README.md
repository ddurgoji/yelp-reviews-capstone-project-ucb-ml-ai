## Summary
#### Business Understanding
Yelp Reviews Dataset contains reviews from Yelp. It is extracted from the Yelp dataset challenge 2015 data. For more information, please refer to http://www.yelp.com/dataset_challenge.

This Yelp reviews dataset is constructued by Xiang Zhang(xiang.zhang@nyu.edu) from the above dataset.  It is first used as a text classification benchmark in the following paper: Xiang Zhang, Junbo Zhao, Yann LeCun. Character-level Convolutional Networks for Text Classification. Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 28 (NIPS 2015).

This Yelp reviews dataset is constructed by considering starts 1 and 2 as negative, 3 and 4 as positive. For each polarity 280k training samples and 19,000 testing samples are taken randomly. In total there are 560k training and 38k testing samples. Negative sentiment reviews are marked as 1 and Positive sentiment reviews are marked as 2.

In this project, i am trying to build various classifier models which helps banks to determine Yelp review comments as positive or negative.
