### Project Title
Yelp Reviews Sentiment analysis by **Dhiraj Durgoji (djdhiraj.8189@gmail.com)**

#### Executive summary
Yelp Reviews Dataset contains reviews from Yelp. It is extracted from the Yelp dataset challenge 2015 data. For more information, please refer to http://www.yelp.com/dataset_challenge.

This Yelp reviews dataset is constructued by Xiang Zhang(xiang.zhang@nyu.edu) from the above dataset.  It is first used as a text classification benchmark in the following paper: Xiang Zhang, Junbo Zhao, Yann LeCun. Character-level Convolutional Networks for Text Classification. Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 28 (NIPS 2015).

This Yelp reviews dataset is constructed by considering starts 1 and 2 as negative, 3 and 4 as positive. For each polarity 280k training samples and 19,000 testing samples are taken randomly. In total there are 560k training and 38k testing samples. Negative sentiment reviews are marked as 1 and Positive sentiment reviews are marked as 2.

#### Rationale
In this project, i am trying to build various classifier models which helps banks to determine Yelp review comments as positive or negative.
This model can be used in real-time to build various solution as listed below.
* Yelp could downgrade ranking of a restaurant if negative ratings increase
* Yelp could show a restaurant on top if their positive rating is high
* Use the sentiment to provide data to restaurant to improve on their service etc.

This helps Yelp to improve user experience by showing right results based on search and also helps Yelp to upsell value add services to restaurants etc.

#### Research Question
Yelp reviews sentiment analysis to upsell value addition products to both end users and restaurants, shops etc.

#### Data Sources
This dataset is from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ilhamfp31/yelp-review-dataset/data)

#### Methodology
Below is the methodology used.

##### Data Understanding
* Read CSV Dataset using Pandas. DataFrame contains Review and Rating columns.
* Train DataFrame has 560,000 records and Test DataFrame has 38,000 records.
* Training dataset has both positive and negative classes balanced.
* Checked dataset for below items in Reviews.
  * Special characters - 410217 out of 560000
  * Short hand words - 394763 out of 560000
  * Stop words - 556099 out of 560000
  * HTTP(S) links - 2501 out of 560000

##### Data Preparation
* Performed below actions
  * Converted all letters to lower case.
  * Removed all special characters
  * Removed Stop words using NLTK
  * Removed HTTP(S) links
  * Removed Accents
  * Normalized spaces
  * Removed short hands
* Checked Sentiment among Positive and Negative classes.
  * Positive rating has majority of reviews with positive sentiment polarity
  * Negative rating has majority of reviews with positive sentiment polarity (Could this cause model to get confused and underfit?)

* Generated word cloud to get insight into most occuring words in both positive and negative rating </br>

#### Modelling
Using train_test_split seperated Training dataset = 80% and Validation Dataset = 20%.

Generated models with below differnet techniques.
* MultinomialNB
* LogisticRegression
* DecisionTreeClassifier
* RandomForestClassifier
* AdaBoostClassifier

#### Results

LogisticRegression performed better with 93% accuracy on Validation dataset. Below is confusion matrix of Logistic Regression high performance model.
